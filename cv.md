### About myself
I started career as 1C developer then I was on a third grade at University. I used to juggle work and studies, so I can manage my time well. I always wanted to work in a big company that’s why I decided to move to Moscow. 

In Moscow I used to work as support and nowadays I’m a senior-support in my team. My duties include mentoring junior supports, interaction with management on employee and project development issues.

I would like to join Frontend Development because it lets you see your job results very soon and opens many possibilities for professional growth.

I consider myself a very purposeful person and this quality, combined with a high level of discipline and creativity, will allow me to achieve high results in a short time.
